## Notes

The most challenging thing about creating this app was being able to get the sizes and constraints right. There would be times where everything would look perfect on the storyboard but come time to run the app, it would stop working. There was also an issue where 2 of my buttons would not do anything when pressed. They ended up being hidden behind an invisible wall.
